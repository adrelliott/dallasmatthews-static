					<description><![CDATA[I know this if off topic but I&#039;m looking into starting my own weblog and was wondering what all is required to get 
set up? I&#039;m assuming having a blog like yours would 
cost a pretty penny? I&#039;m not very internet smart so I&#039;m not 100% certain. Any suggestions or advice would be greatly appreciated.
Appreciate it]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Fantastic blog! Do you have any tips and hints 
for aspiring writers? I&#039;m planning to start my own website soon but I&#039;m a little lost 
on everything. Would you propose starting with a free platform like Wordpress 
or go for a paid option? There are so many choices out there that I&#039;m completely confused ..

Any recommendations? Kudos!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Everything posted made a great deal of sense. However, consider this, suppose you were to write a killer headline?
I ain&#039;t suggesting your content isn&#039;t solid, but suppose you added something that makes people want 
more? I mean Turn your Twitter icon into an animated GIF &#8211; Dallas Matthews &#124; Marketing Agency 
is a little boring. You should glance at Yahoo&#039;s home page and watch how they write post headlines to get 
people to click. You might add a related video or a picture or two to get people excited about everything&#039;ve written. Just my opinion, it could bring your website 
a little bit more interesting.]]></description>
